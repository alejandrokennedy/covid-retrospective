1,,,"<p><span class=""firstcharacter"">J</span>ust over two years since SARS-Cov-2 first emerged in Wuhan, China, the coronavirus has killed more than 6 million and sickened hundreds of millions more around the world. In that time, many governments — from the local to national level — have gone to extraordinary lengths to combat the spread of the deadly pathogen, from closing borders and implementing contact tracing systems to adopting mask mandates and shutting down businesses. Others — including at times the United States —  have downplayed the severity of the virus and touted unproven treatments against it.</p><p>As health care workers burned out, the development of vaccines brought new hope. But even with billions of shots now in arms, much of the world’s population has yet to receive a single dose. While many people living in low-income countries simply still lack access, pockets of Americans and others have chosen to willfully forgo the vaccine — and push back on efforts to mandate it. Following the rise of Delta, the Omicron variant swept the globe, its sheer numbers inundating hospitals.</p><p> While cases declined in many parts of the globe following records in January of this year, a new Omicron subvariant is causing new spikes, including in Hong Kong and the U.K. As the pandemic enters its third year, scientists are scrambling to determine where things are headed next. But what may already be clear, many experts say, is that the coronavirus is likely to become endemic — meaning rather than disappearing, it will become less disruptive as the population builds immunity over time. In the meantime, here’s a look back at how the pandemic has played out in the U.S. so far.</p>",,center,
